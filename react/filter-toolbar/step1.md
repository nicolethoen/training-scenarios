Toolbars can be included to allow a user to manage and manipulate a data set. Data can be presented in any valid presentation, a table, a list, or a data visualization (chart), for example. The PatternFly Toolbar component is a flexible layout system that accommodates a variety of configurations that can be adapted to your specific needs.
